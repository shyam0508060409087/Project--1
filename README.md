# Java Mini Projects â€“ Basics Practice

This repository is a part of my personal learning journey to strengthen my core Java programming concepts during my 2-month vacation after completing the 2nd semester of my Computer Science Engineering degree. These mini projects helped me practice hands-on coding and reinforced concepts like loops, functions, arrays, matrices, and more.

The goal was to apply what Iâ€™ve learned in a practical and consistent way, and this collection showcases that progress.

The programs included in this repository are:

- A **Multiplication Table Generator** that takes a number and a range from the user and displays its multiplication table using a simple `for` loop.
- A **Function-Based Calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using modular functions, menu-driven input, and `switch-case` statements.
- A **Result Checker** that allows the user to input marks for multiple subjects and checks if the student has passed in all of them based on a minimum threshold.
- A **Matrix Transposer** that accepts a 2D matrix from the user and prints its transpose by swapping rows with columns using nested loops.

Each project was created to solidify my understanding of different foundational concepts in Java:

- **Loops:** Used in table generation and matrix transposition.
- **Functions:** Applied in the calculator project to modularize arithmetic operations.
- **Conditionals and Input Handling:** Present throughout for user decision-making and result checking.
- **2D Arrays:** Practiced in the matrix transpose program.

### ðŸ’» How to Run These Programs

Each `.java` file in this repository can be compiled and run from the command line:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName


ðŸ“Œ Why These Projects?
These small-scale projects allowed me to:

Practice Java syntax and logic building

Gain confidence in writing clean and modular code

Prepare a base for upcoming Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Showcase my consistency and learning publicly on GitHub and LinkedIn

They reflect my dedication toward upskilling as I move into the second year of my CSE journey.
